            <p class="bio">Here comes Daredevil…the Man Without Fear! When young Matt Murdock, son of prizefighter "Battlin'" Jack Murdock, heroically saves a man's life by pushing him out of the way of a chemical truck, he is splashed with radioactive waste that robs him of his sight! But as the boy recovers, he soon realizes that his other senses have compensated for the loss - including a new, uncanny radar sense! Growing up, Matt studies law and becomes an attorney - but when tragedy strikes his family, he puts his skills to use and dons a colorful costume to take vengeance on the crime boss known as the Fixer! Hell's Kitchen will never be the same now that Daredevil is on the scene! It's one of the all-time great Marvel comic books, boldly re-presented in its original form, ads and all! Re-presenting DAREDEVIL (1963) #1.   </p>
